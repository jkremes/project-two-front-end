This is the beginning of my README file for the project-two-client.

My project can be found at the following urls:
https://jkremes-project-two.herokuapp.com
https://jkremes.github.io/project-two-front-end/

And the repos located at:

What does this app do?
-It currently stores articles of clothing under the hood of the class Laundry. It allows the user to authenticate by signing-in after they have already established an account which can be done by signing-up. A user can sign-out and change-password once signed in. Also, after signing-in they can create, update, destroy, and show(one or many based on a search bar) article(s) of clothing within the class laundry. The user can only manipulate articles that belong to them. There is conveniently located buttons in the nav bar and a welcome jumbo message for the user as well as a help button for further instruction. Each form entry has a placeholder that explains to the user what to enter.

Technologies used:
-bootstrap
  --first time using modals
-jQuery
-Ajax
-javascript
-html
-scss

Unsolved/Future Features:
-nav bar needs better formatting
-adding tables like brand names to associate with each article of clothing
-building out more tables and relationships
-only allowing user to update or create within certain limitations(potentialy have a dropdown menu for what options are available)
-create another interface to find all clothing owned by a user (based on relationship)
-updated styling
-more professional appearance

Planning:
I started by writing out user stories and having a gameplan of how I would approach building out this app. Ironically that planning was about more planning.

One example of a user story I started out with:
Authentication:
-I want to sign-up
-I want to sign-in
-I want to change my password
-I want to sign-out

Interaction:
-I want to understand what Iâ€™m doing on the site
-I want to see the table
-If there is no table, I want to know what my next step is
-I want to be able to create an article of clothing
-I want to be able to modify an article of clothing
-I want to be able to remove an article of clothing
-I want to be able to see all my articles of clothing
-I want to be able to see just one article of clothing

I made sure to start out coding very slow and methodically. This proved a very successful approach as I felt I was flying through the requirements. Eventually as this built out and things got more complicated I had to continue to remind myself to take steps back and think through my code line by line and get successes at each step in the process rather than trying to write out a whole function and seeing it not work and having no idea why. There is plenty more I could add here about the process, feel free to shoot me a message and I'll be happy to respond!

Below is the link for my original wireframe and Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). Eventually I would like to have these done in a more professional appearance and available on a public image directory. And will also host my user-stories built out.
